## First Workshop on NLP for Internet Freedom
 
According to the recent report produced by Freedom House (freedomhouse.org), an  “independent watchdog organization dedicated to the expansion of freedom and democracy around the world”, Internet freedom declined in 2016 for the sixth consecutive year. 67% of all Internet users live in countries where criticism of the government, military, or ruling family are subject to censorship.  Social media users face unprecedented penalties, as authorities in 38 countries made arrests based on social media posts over the past year. Globally, 27 percent of all internet users live in countries where people have been arrested for publishing, sharing, or merely “liking” content on Facebook. Governments are increasingly going after messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, which can spread information quickly and securely.

Various barriers exist to prevent citizens of a large number of countries to access information. Some involve infrastructural and economic barriers, others  violations of user rights such as surveillance, privacy and repercussions for online speech and activities such as imprisonment, extralegal harassment or cyberattacks. Yet another area is limits on content, which involves legal regulations on content, technical filtering and blocking websites, (self-)censorship.

Large internet providers are effective monopolies, and themselves have the power to use NLP techniques to control information flow. Users are suspended or banned, sometimes without human intervention, and with little opportunity for redress. Users react to this by using coded, oblique or metaphorical  language, by taking steps to conceal their identity such as the use of multiple accounts, raising questions about who the real originating author of a post actually is.

This workshop should bring together NLP researchers whose work contributes to the free flow of information on the Internet.  The topics of interest include (but are not limited) to the following:

- Censorship detection: detecting deleted or edited text; detecting blocked keywords/banned terms;
- Censorship circumvention techniques: linguistically inspired countermeasure for Internet censorship such as keyword substitution, expanding coverage of existing banned terms,  text paraphrasing, linguistic steganography, generating information morphs etc.;
- Detection of self-censorship;
- Identifying potentially censorable content;
- Disinformation/Misinformation detection: fake news,  fake accounts, rumor detection, etc.;
- Techniques to empirically measure Internet censorship across communication platforms;
- Investigations on covert linguistic communication and its limits;
- Identity and private information detection;
- Passive and targeted surveillance techniques;
- Ethics in NLP;
- “Walled gardens”, personalization and fragmentation of the online public space;

We hope that our workshop will promote Internet freedom in countries where accessing and sharing of information are strictly controlled by censorship.

#### Title
How the Chinese Government Fabricates Social Media Posts for Strategic Distraction, Not Engaged Argument
#### Abstract
The Chinese government has long been suspected of hiring as many as 2 million people to surreptitiously insert huge numbers of pseudonymous and other deceptive writings into the stream of real social media posts, as if they were the genuine opinions of ordinary people. Many academics, and most journalists and activists, claim that these so-called 50c party posts vociferously argue for the government’s side in political and policy debates. As we show, this is also true of most posts openly accused on social media of being 50c. Yet almost no systematic empirical evidence exists for this claim or, more importantly, for the Chinese regime’s strategic objective in pursuing this activity. In the first large-scale empirical analysis of this operation, we show how to identify the secretive authors of these posts, the posts written by them, and their content. In contrast to prior claims, the Chinese regime’s strategy is to avoid arguing with skeptics of the party and the government, and to not even discuss controversial issues. The goal of this massive secretive operation is instead to distract the public and change the subject, as most of these posts involve cheerleading for China, the revolutionary history of the Communist Party, or other symbols of the regime.
